KeyFast is an exhilarating video game developed with Unity and C# that puts your coordination and agility skills to the test. Embark on a thrilling race through 20 levels brimming with obstacles, and aim to reach the finish line in each level without touching the walls. Precision and quick reflexes are key to mastering this challenge!

With 100 lives at your disposal, you'll have multiple opportunities to perfect your strategy and conquer each level. However, every wall you touch will decrease your lives, so you'll need to be both cautious and strategic to avoid running out of lives before completing the game.

Test your reflexes, enhance your dexterity, and become the ultimate master of KeyFast!
